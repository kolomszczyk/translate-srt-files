00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,208
John, what's the matter
with you?

177

-Nothing.
-There's obviously something.

You're just imagining it, John.

184

-Is it suitable for your age?
-Aye, I think so.

-Um... I don't think so.
-You don't think so?

194

So what's it about then,
this film?

195
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,958
It's about a man
who dresses as a woman. [laughs]

196

Well, that's not a good start,
is it?

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,542
I will give you the opportunity
here, now,

339
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,292
to admit that this is
all imagined, invented,

340
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,208
purely for attention.

341
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,417
It's not, sir.

342
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,208
Think very carefully,
Mr Davidson.

343
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,375
One last chance.

344
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,958
I can't help it.

345
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:24,500
Then there's nothing
we can do for you.

346
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:28,542
If it is not a scam,
you should be in an institution.

347
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,667
[tics]

348
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,667
What is the matter with you,
boy?

349
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,417
[John] I don't know, sir.

350
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,708
If you do not stop this
behaviour, prison waits.

351
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,333
And if not prison,
something far worse.

352
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,333
The real world, Mr Davidson,
outside of this school,

353
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,833
will not be as sympathetic
as we have been.

354
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:46,667
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

355
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,542
I'll be in touch with
your parents shortly. Out!

356
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:55,083
-[sighs]
-[John] You cunt!

357
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,250
Mr Davidson.

358
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,917
[John sighs]

359
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:02,125
Before you leave...

360
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,875
[clears throat]
Now, before we have dinner,

361
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,083
I have something to tell you.

362
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,208
Your dad is leaving.

363
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,833
Leaving home, for good.

364
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,042
He's not coming back.

365
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,542
-Now eat your dinner.
-Why?

366
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,875
Because of me.

367
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,917
It's because of me,
Mum, isn't it?

368
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,333
It is what it is.

369
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,667
[John] Because of me,
though, isn't it?

370
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,250
Mum.

371
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,167
Answer me!

372
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,125
[tics]

373
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,000
[tics]

374
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,750
Fuck off.

375
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:49,417
[tics]

376
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,875
[exhales]

377
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:06,833
[tics]

378
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:48,750
[siren wails]

379
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,083
I've prescribed diazepam, five
milligrams, every three hours.

380
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't understand,
he's only 13.

381
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,917
All he did
was fall in the river.

382
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,458
I'm not convinced he fell,
Mrs Davidson.

383
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:07,875
-[John] I'm going mad.
-[mother] No. Don't be silly.

384
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:12,333
-I made Dad leave.
-No, John. No.

385
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,708
Just...

386
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,625
I can't take it.

387
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,875
I just feel like killing myself.

388
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,750
No, don't say things like that.

389
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,333
Everything's going to be fine.

390
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:33,000
We're going to get you better

391
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,125
in next to no time.

392
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,083
It's OK, John.

393
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,167
Shh.

394
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,833
It's all OK.

395
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:47,208
Yes. Shh. Go to sleep now.

396
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:49,625
Go to sleep, John.

397
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:51,958
Go to sleep.

398
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:56,833
[birds sing]

399
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,042
[tics]

400
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,625
[sighs]

401
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,625
[tics]

402
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,333
They're wondering
what you were shouting at.

403
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,292
-[tics]
-[sighs]

404
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,958
Shh, John. Come on.

405
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:28,875
-Sixty-watt bulb will be fine.
-[tics]

406
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:33,208
Now, um, need to get
some potatoes for dinner.

407
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:35,250
-[John] What are they for?
-For boiling.

408
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,875
-Two of those, they'll be fine.
-I'll get four just in case.

409
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:40,583
-What else?
-Fuck.

410
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:42,708
What else do I need, John?

411
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,500
I need some new toothpaste,
Mum.

412
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:46,208
Have you finished
your current one?

413
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,750
-Almost.
-Wait till it's all gone.

414
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,125
before we get a new one.

415
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:51,458
-No worries.
-Remind me to get Oxo cubes.

416
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:53,708
Is that for a stew? A stew!

417
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,833
-Stop it.
-Sorry.

418
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,875
[Murray] Johnny D. Jesus!

419
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,875
-How you doing, pal?
-I thought I heard you.

420
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,375
-You good?
-Yeah.

421
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:05,500
Hiya, Mrs Davidson. I'm Murray,
John's pal from school.

422
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:10,292
Murray, how are you? I didn't
recognise you. All grown up.

423
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,625
-You're looking well.
-Thank you.

424
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:15,833
I've been over in Australia.
I had a job and everything,

425
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:18,833
but my mum's not doing too well,
so I had to come home.

426
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:20,958
I'm sorry about that, Murray.

427
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:22,625
It's all right.
Fancy a wee drink, John?

428
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:23,833
Have a wee catch-up?

429
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:27,042
No, he can't drink, Murray.
He's on medication.

430
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,583
-All right.
-Hm-hmm.

431
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,833
-Could maybe just go for a walk?
-A wank. That would be good.

432
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:34,833
Would you like that, John?
A walk with Murray?

433
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:37,708
To give me a break?
And I'll see you at home?

434
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:38,917
Hmm.

435
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,958
-It's good to see you.
-See you at the front?

436
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,625
-Yeah.
-Bye.

437
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,875
-[tics]
-Now, I need to get some coffee.

438
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:51,083
It's difficult to explain.
It's sort of like...

439
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,333
an impulse in my brain
that makes me do things,

440
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,333
or say things that I shouldn't.

441
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:59,708
It's called Tourette's syndrome,
apparently.

442
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,417
Well, that's good then,
that they know what it is.

443
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,708
Aye. It was brilliant
for the first few days

444
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,917
until they said
there was no cure.

445
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,458
Jesus, John, I'm sorry.

446
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,833
So what happens now then?

447
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,167
-Looking for a job?
-[John] Aye, I'd love one,

448
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,500
but, you know, what can I do?

449
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:18,375
What will they let me do?

450
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:22,167
Anyway, tell us about Australia.

451
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,125
-Oh, it was mental.
-Was it?

452
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:25,583
Travelled all about.

453
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:28,958
Saw the Great Barrier Reef,
worked on a sheep farm.

454
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:32,458
-Wow.
-I had to come back early cos...

455
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:35,750
I don't know if you ever
met my mum, did you?

456
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,000
She's got cancer.

457
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:41,333
-Cancer of the liver.
-Oh, Jesus, Murray.

458
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:44,250
Given her six months to live.

459
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,125
[John] Sorry, pal.

460
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,542
[Murray] Want to come in
for something to eat?

461
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,292
-[John] No, I'm good, thank you.
-Come on.

462
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,292
[John]
I need to get back. I'm tired.

463
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:55,458
-Gotta take my tablets. Hitler!
-OK. No worries.

464
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:57,250
[Murray] You wanna
do something soon,

465
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,542
-give me a shout.
-No worries.

466
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,333
-See you soon, Murray.
-See you.

467
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:03,042
Smells like spaghetti bolognese.
Sure you don't want some?

468
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,917
No, I'm OK. Hitler!

469
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,750
[woman] Oi.

470
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,875
What's wrong with
my spaghetti bolognese?

471
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,875
I'm sure it's great.
I just need to be getting home.

472
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,667
[woman] What's your name?

473
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,625
John.

474
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:22,333
John, get your arse in here.
Be on the table in two minutes.

475
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:23,875
-No, honestly...
-[slams]

476
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,125
[sighs] Fuck you in particular.
Fuck, fuck you in particular.

477
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,708
[sighs] God, John.

479
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,750
Come on, John.

480
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,458
Oh.

481
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,333
Come on in, love. I'm Dottie.

482
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,583
You're gonna die of cancer.
Ha-ha!

483
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:05,333
For fuck's sakes, John.
I'm sorry.

484
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,417
Right.

485
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,583
Well, it's nice to meet you too.

486
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,542
I'm really, really sorry.

487
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,542
You're all right.

488
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:19,125
You know, that's the most honest
anyone's been with me in months.

489
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:22,833
Well, come on. Go and sit down.

490
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,708
Are you sure?

491
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:28,833
You're all right, I don't bite.
[chuckles]

492
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:33,208
-Shall I take my shoes off?
-No, we're not fancy in here.

493
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:45,583
John? It's getting cold.

494
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:48,542
Aye, you carry on. No worries.

495
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:51,542
[exhales]

496
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,833
Right. Let's eat.

497
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,333
[tics] Cunt.

498
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,917

500
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,583
What the hell was that?

501
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:19,833
Murray?

502
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,375
I don't know.

503
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,708
Mum, he's not been well.
He's on medication.

504
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,958
I thought as much.

505
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,083
[dad] Do you wanna check
if he's all right?

506
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,917
[sighs] Can I not eat first?

507
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,542
Right, well, let's just
give him a minute, OK?

508
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,542
[knocks on door]

509
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,542
[Dottie] John?

510
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,542

-Nice to meet you, too.

852
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:57,250
-Oh!
-[clattering]

853
00:53:58,208 --> 00:54:00,500
I'm really, really sorry
about that.

854
00:54:00,542 --> 00:54:02,292
No worries, John.

855
00:54:02,792 --> 00:54:05,167
[tics softly]

856
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:08,250
[man whistles]

857
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:13,000
This is Tommy, our caretaker.

858
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,167
-Oh!
-Oop, sorry.

859
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,458
I'll help you with that.

860
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:20,292
-Ooh, the boy's keen.
-[Irene] Tommy, this is John.

861
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:22,125
He's come to chat
about the vacant position.

862
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,583
-All right, John?
-Nice to meet you.

863
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,125
-How are you?
-Good.

864
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:27,458
-Dottie told me a lot about you.
-Good.

865
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:29,875
-We'll leave you two together.
-[tics]

866
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,500
Aye. Irene, did you get
that note about the blue roll?

867
00:54:32,542 --> 00:54:34,583
-Yeah. No worries.
-Right. Thank you.

868
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:35,833
-All right, John?
-All right.

869
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:38,708
Right, OK, be on your desk.

870
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:40,583
-All right, John?
-Yeah, good.

871
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:42,458
-John.
-Nice to meet you.

872
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:46,208
You, too. Uh, right, I'll give
you a rundown of the place.

873
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:49,292
Give me your cock in my hand.
Fuck's sakes.

874
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:53,125
-So, this is the main hall.
-Right.

875
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:57,375
And, uh, to be honest, a lot of
what I do is health and safety.

876
00:54:57,458 --> 00:55:01,292
You know, fire escapes, fire
extinguishers, smoke alarms.

877
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,083
-Aye, easy peasy.
-That kind of stuff, you know.

878
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:07,250
Uh, if you were to get the job,
and it's an "if", remember,

879
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:09,583
because I'm seeing
a few youngsters.

880
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:12,167
-I know.
-OK. Just so you know that.

881
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,125
Wrinkly bastard.

882
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:19,208
You've got different events,
uh, require different things.

883
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:20,833
So, like, a wee council meeting

884
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,542
could be
just a couple of tables.

885
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:26,000
Then again, you could be laying
out 200 seats for a pantomime.

886
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:28,917
-Or a school theatre production.
-I'm a paedophile.

887
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,917
Sorry, it was a tic.

888
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,083
That's all right, it's OK.

889
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,875
-Want me to show you outside?
-Aye, that would be good.

890
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,583
Right, good, good.

891
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:41,875
[John tics]

892
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,875
-Um, uh...
-[banging]

893
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,167
I need to fix this.
There we go.

894
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,625
Right, so, we plant these
every spring,

895
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:52,000
so they need watering
and weeding,

896
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,167
and fed. You know about plants?

897
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,875
Aye. I love plants.
Two in my garden.

898
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,042
Right, good. Um, this area
is the bane of my life.

899
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:02,125
Do you ever shut the fuck up?

900
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,708
Bane of my life, this area,
because of this.

901
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:07,292
This provides cover
for the smokers.

902
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:10,333
So the smokers come out here
and they smoke.

903
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:13,250
And then what do they do?
They drop their filthy fags.

904
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,250
Filthy fags! Filthy fags!

905
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:23,667
Filthy fags! I'm gay.
No, I'm not. Yes, I am.

906
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,500
Filthy fags!

907
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:28,542
It's quite echoey in there,
isn't it?

908
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:31,125
Aye, it is quite... echoey.

909
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:38,042
Just close the door behind you.
You OK with dogs?

910
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:41,625
-Aye, I love dogs.
-This is Rosie.

911
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:45,167
-Hello, Rosie. How are you?
-Um...

912
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,833
-You OK sitting there?
-[bangs]

913
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,458
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm good.

914
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,542
-OK. Don't hit the furniture.
-Sorry, sorry.

915
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:52,667
All right, OK, just take a seat.

916
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,417
Right.

917
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,500
So, now we get to
the most important part

918
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:00,542
-of the interview, John.
-Bum sex.

919
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:06,583
And that is, can you make
a decent cup of tea?

920
00:57:06,667 --> 00:57:08,042
[John] Oh, aye. I'm good at tea.

921
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,792
I like it strong, lots of milk,
three sugar.

922
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:12,917
No bother, Tommy.

923
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:17,000
[kettle boils]

924
00:57:20,542 --> 00:57:23,333
And remember, put the water
in first, then the milk.

925
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:27,542
OK, yeah. I do that as well.

926
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:32,042
Right, we'll get to you
in a minute, John.

927
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:33,833
So, what have they told you
about me?

928
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:37,167
Um, they just said that you've
not been very well lately.

929
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:43,292
Right. The plan is to get in
a youngster, you learn the job,

930
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:47,042
so that if I've got a hospital
appointment, or whatever...

931
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:49,708
-Aye.
-..they can step in

932
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:52,833
-and keep things going.
-Hmm, yeah.

933
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:54,917
Well, I read a bit about
the job, you know,

934
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:56,750
and the hours and that.

935
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:59,875
-Interested in giving it a go.
-Right.

936
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:02,375
-You reliable?
-Aye.

937
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:05,417
I'm always early, always.
I have to be, you know.

938
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,292
Cos I need someone to be here
on time, to open up,

939
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:10,542
and to be here to lock up
when I'm not here.

940
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:14,083
-Aye, any time. Any time.
-Right.

941
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:16,625
-Good with your hands?
-I was good at school, you know.

942
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:20,125
Woodwork and metalwork and that.
But I'm keen to learn, and...

943
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,792
I don't mind getting
my hands dirty, you know?

944
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:26,042
-OK.
-I'm a lazy bastard.

945
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:29,250
-So, you don't mind hard work?
-No.

946
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:32,750
In fact, when I'm concentrating
on the job or a project,

947
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:35,292
I think it really helps me.

948
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:36,833
Right.

949
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:41,792
-That's hot.
-Aye.

950
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:44,625
There you go, Tommy. [spits]

951
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:49,000
I'm really sorry.
I'll take that one.

952
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:51,292
Aye, that's a good idea.

953
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,667
Hm-hmm.

954
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:06,167
I've seen quite a few youngsters
for this job.

955
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,542
-Aye.
-And I don't think

956
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm breaking confidentiality
when I tell you

957
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:14,208
that that is
the best cup of tea yet.

958
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:15,375
[John] Great.

959
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,625
[Tommy sighs] So...

960
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:20,000
I use spunk for milk.

961
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:26,292
Right, so,
have you any questions for me?

962
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:27,667
Um...

963
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:30,458
Oh, aye, yeah. Um...

964
00:59:30,542 --> 00:59:34,792
I might have to take a few days
off work, in a few months,

965
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:37,875
because I've got a court trial
coming up.

966
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,125
-Just that.
-So you've not even got the job

967
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:43,167
but already you're looking
for a day off?

968
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,292
No, no. I'm just saying that...
You're fucking it up, John.

969
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:49,625
Um, I'm just saying that,
if I were to get the job,

970
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:52,625
I'd have to take that time.
I just wanted to be honest.

971
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:54,042
Right.

972
00:59:55,542 --> 00:59:59,583
-Get in a wee scrape, did you?
-Aye.

973
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:02,458
I've had a bit of bad luck
recently.

974
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:07,000
-Was it your fault?
-No.

975
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:15,167
OK. That's good enough for me.

976
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,542
-Any other questions?
-Um...

977
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:21,917
I can do the job, you know.

978
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:24,875
-I can do it.
-Hm-hmm.

979
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,708
But just the obvious question,
really, um...

980
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,333
Are you OK with the tics
and the swearing?

981
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:38,292
What tics? What swearing?
[chuckles]

982
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,125
[chuckles]

983
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:43,917
[dog yelps, whines]

984
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,708
Uh...

985
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:53,042
Just a wee word of warning,
John. Uh...

986
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:55,792
You ever do that
to my dog again,

987
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:59,292
and I'll tear your fucking
heart out. Understand?

988
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:06,000
Right, well...

989
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,917
Thanks for seeing me.

990
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:14,667
OK, I'll get off, then.

991
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:23,542
-All right, Rosie?
-[dog pants]

992
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,833
[indistinct chatter]

993
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,083
-Oh, hiya, John.
-All right, pal. How you doing?

994
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:37,708
Good, good.

995
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:40,833
-Paper and Opal Fruits, please.
-So, how you been keeping?

996
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:43,667
Ah, not so bad. Had a
job interview today, Kenny.

997
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:48,125
-Oh, right. How did that go?
-I hit the boss's dog.

998
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,917
Ach, well, never mind.

999
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:52,000
You can always come back
to your old paper round.

1000
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,292
I might hold you to that, Kenny.
I'll see you later.

1001
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:56,083
Take care. Yes, love?

1002
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,000
Slut!

1003
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:03,542
What did you say?

1004
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:05,458
I'm sorry, miss.
I've got Tourette's.

1005
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:07,833
-What did you just say to me?
-I'm really sorry.

1006
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:10,667
I mean no harm.
I can't help what I say.

1007
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,917
-I'm sorry.
-Fuck off!

1008
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,042
[exhales]

1009
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,458
[kettle boils]

1010
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,917
Anyone home?
[clears throat] Dot?

1011
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:48,292
-What are you doing?
-[stifled laughter]

1012
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:50,292
Wait a minute, John.

1013
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:52,542
[screams] You got it!

1014
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,167
[Chris] Tommy called.
You got the job.

1015
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,333
The job?

1016
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:58,000
-You start on Monday.
-Oh, my God!

1017
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,500
Well done, John.

1018
01:03:01,542 --> 01:03:03,042
-Are you serious?
-[Dottie] Aye.

1019
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:05,833
-You deserve it.
-Well done, Davidson.

1020
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:08,750
I can't believe that.
It went so bad.

1021
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,667
-You deserve that.
-[laughs]

1022
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,208
-And now you've...
-God, I've got a job.

1023
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:15,917
I don't wanna steal
your thunder...

1024
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,625
-Aye, but you will.
-Um...

1025
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:19,500
Chris and I went
to the hospital today.

1026
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:22,500
You're dying of cancer,
you old fucker. [tics]

1027
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:26,875
I'm not, John. Um...
They made a mistake.

1028
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,167
-It's not cancer.
-[chuckles]

1029
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,625
-It's called haema...
-[chuckles]

1030
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:34,000
Haemanagi... ngioma.

1031
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:36,625
-Ham shandy, you cunt.
-[laughter]

1032
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:38,167
What is it, love?

1033
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,542
Haemangioma.
You know, it's a lump.

1034
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,333
But anyway, it's not cancer.

1035
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:47,042
It looks like cancer,
but it's not. [laughs]

1036
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:48,750
Come here.

1037
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:50,917
[Murray] I love you, Mum.

1038
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:55,042
I love you all!
[laughs and kisses]

1039
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:58,875
-[John] I can't believe that.
-All right, John, here. Um...

1040
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Go to the Chinese and get
what anyone wants.

1041
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:05,875
A banquet. It's my treat,
double celebration.

-[food sizzles]

1043
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:35,042

-I am! Fucker!

-Who's this?
-That fucking...

1050
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:17,083
Move, move, move!

01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:18,542
Move, move!

a fucking slut now, eh?

1054
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:27,667
Fuck you!

1055
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,875
Fucking go, get out of here!

1056
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,375
Think you're a fucking
tough guy, eh?

1057
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,333
Take the fucking warning.

1058
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:38,208
[muffled groan]

1059
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:42,083
You've been fucking warned.

1060
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:57,000
-[grunts]
-[Dottie] John, it's all right.

1061
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,583
It's all right.

1062
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:02,167
-Dottie's here. I'm here.
-[grunts]

1063
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,083
[Dottie shushes softly]

1064
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,208
Hmm.

1065
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,417
Sweetheart.

1066
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:20,125
I'm gonna have to call your mum.

1067
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:24,833
-No.
-John.

1068
01:06:24,917 --> 01:06:27,625
-No.
-John, I have to.

1069
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:31,542
You'll just worry her.
It's fine.

1070
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:38,375
[sighs]
That job starts on Monday.

1071
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:42,667
[Dottie] Tommy says you're
to take as long as you need, hm?

1072
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,500
Job's yours.

1073
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:49,125
-It's not going anywhere.
-[John] That's good.

1074
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:53,083
Oh, love, love. You're all
right, you're all right.

1075
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:54,792
Come on, sweetheart, calm down.

1076
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:59,125
-[grunts]
-You're all right. Shh.

1077
01:07:02,792 --> 01:07:05,417
-I know.
-[grunts]

1078
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:08,125
[shushes]

1079
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,917
I know.

1080
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:15,083
-It's all right.
-[exhales]

1081
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:17,417
You're all right, hey?

1082
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:20,250
[tics]

1083
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:25,000
-[groans]
-Come on. Shh. Come on.

1084
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:29,208
Come on.

1085
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:34,167
I know. Hmm?

1086
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:44,292
I'm tired of this, Dottie.

1087
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:52,208
I'm so tired.

1088
01:07:52,292 --> 01:07:55,333
[Dottie] I know you are, love.
I know.

1089
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:04,750
[♪ "Merry Xmas Everybody"
by Slade]

1090
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,082
[tics]

1091
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:24,250
[song continues in the distance]

1092
01:08:32,457 --> 01:08:34,292
How you getting on
with those chairs, son?

1093
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:37,042
[John] Aye, no bother, Tommy.

1094
01:08:38,542 --> 01:08:40,125
[Tommy] Oh, my God.

1095
01:08:40,207 --> 01:08:43,042
You've got them straighter
than I could ever have got them.

1096
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:44,292
Gotta be straight, Tom.

1097
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:47,417
I gotta count them as well.
Gotta be ten chairs, four rows.

1098
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,082
An even number,
otherwise it's not right.

1099
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,500
Is it the numbers that gets
to you, or is it the shape?

1100
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:57,917
Ah, it's all of it.
If it's not right,

1101
01:08:58,042 --> 01:09:00,457
then I just think bad things
are going to happen.

1102
01:09:00,542 --> 01:09:01,917
[Tommy] Like what?

1103
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:05,000
Well, sometimes I'm putting
my hand under boiling water,

1104
01:09:05,082 --> 01:09:08,417
and I've gotta do it four times,
otherwise you're going to die.

1105
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,250
-Excuse me?
-I know. [chuckles]

1106
01:09:10,332 --> 01:09:11,832
But, like, another thing I do,

1107
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:14,250
and this is really weird,
is I'm walking down the street

1108
01:09:14,332 --> 01:09:16,667
and I see a lamppost,
and say it's not straight

1109
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:18,457
or it's at the wrong angle,

1110
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:21,042
or a different colour or
something, I have to kiss it.

1111
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:23,332
-You have to kiss a lamppost?
-Yeah.

1112
01:09:23,417 --> 01:09:26,125
[Tommy] Ah, you never
told me that at your interview.

1113
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:27,917
-You never asked.
-Yeah.

1114
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:31,250
[Tommy] And it's always the tics
that cause the problem?

1115
01:09:31,332 --> 01:09:32,625
Aye, yeah, always the tics.

1116
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:35,500
You know what I was thinking?
Tell you what I was thinking.

1117
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:38,500
How would you feel about
letting people into your head

1118
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:40,000
the way you let me
into your head?

1119
01:09:40,082 --> 01:09:41,625
-Nah, I can't do that.
-No, hear me out.

1120
01:09:41,707 --> 01:09:44,292
Cos I don't think
Tourette's is the problem.

1121
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:47,250
I think the problem is we don't
know enough about Tourette's.

1122
01:09:47,332 --> 01:09:49,500
So, if you don't educate
the police

1123
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:51,125
and the doctors
and the teachers,

1124
01:09:51,207 --> 01:09:52,457
if you don't educate them,

1125
01:09:52,542 --> 01:09:55,625
-nothing's gonna change.
-So what do you want me to do?

1126
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:57,708
Walk into a police station
calling them "pigs",

1127
01:09:57,792 --> 01:10:00,125
or into a school and say,
"I'm a paedo"?

1128
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:03,500
Yes, abso-fucking-lutely.
There, you see?

1129
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:06,000
You see? You're not
the only one that can swear.

1130
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:08,250
I swear when I feel strongly
about something,

1131
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,292
when I feel passionate
about something,

1132
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:11,750
and I feel strongly about this.

1133
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,292
Why don't you stop
giving a flying fuck

1134
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:18,125
about what people think
about you and educate them?

1135
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:20,875
Ya cunt, you.

1136
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,833
See what I did there?
That's emphasis.

1137
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:25,167
-I saw that.
-Ya cunt, you.

1138
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,667
-Go on.
-Ya cunt, you.

1139
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:29,708
I put a bit of leg movement
in there.

1140
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:32,917
-Yeah, you got a carabiner.
-Fucking cunt, you.

1141
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:35,875
[John] I need that time off,
Tom, for the day in court.

1142
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,458
I know, I saw that.
You OK about it?

1143
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:40,083
Terrified.

1144
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,750
Fucking hell, John.

1145
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:46,458
-Sorry.
-John.

1146
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,542
-It's Christmas.
-[laughs]

1147
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:53,375
Seriously.
Jesus Christ almighty.

1148
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,583
-Right, OK.
-[laughs]

1149
01:10:56,667 --> 01:10:58,000
What's next?

1150
01:10:58,083 --> 01:11:00,750
What's next is
keeping my balls protected.

1151
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:03,875
[lawyer] My client
is now going to give evidence.

1152
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:06,042
Mr Davidson,
will you please make your way

1153
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:09,375
-to the witness box?
-[clears throat]

1154
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:21,792
Mr Davidson,
will you take the oath?

1155
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,250
I will.

1156
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:26,208
[judge] Please raise your right
hand, and repeat after me...

1157
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,375
I swear by Almighty God...

1158
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,292
I swear by Almighty God...

1159
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:34,083
-..that I will tell the truth...
-..that I will tell the truth...

1160
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:36,417
-..the whole truth...
-No, I won't!

1161
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:42,042
Please, can someone explain
the reason for this contempt?

1162
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:43,417
My lord, if I may,

1163
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:47,000
Mr Davidson, on occasion,
shouts things uncontrollably.

1164
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:50,458
Impulsive comments. He neither
means them or can control them.

1165
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:52,708
Sexist, homophobic,
misogynistic...

1166
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:55,125
Don't forget racist, you wanker.

1167
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:56,458
[lawyer] And racist.

1168
01:11:56,542 --> 01:11:58,917
Based on personal experience,
I can assure you

1169
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,708
he is well versed in all manner
of racist comments,

1170
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:03,625
many of which not even
I have encountered,

1171
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:06,167
but all completely
out of his control.

1172
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,292
We lodged production number 71

1173
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:11,042
detailing a condition
known as Tourette's syndrome.

1174
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:14,542
Yes, I have read the document,

1175
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:18,333
but I have also considered
production number 107

1176
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,625
-from Mr Barrowman...
-Fuck, cunt.

1177
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:22,667
..which claims that
Tourette's syndrome

1178
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,500
is not a recognised condition.

1179
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:26,542
That it cannot be diagnosed,

1180
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:29,208
and therefore
is irrelevant to this case.

1181
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:30,792
[Barrowman] Thank you, my lord.

1182
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:33,875
Mr Davidson, the oath,

1183

pronounced by me.

1184
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:37,333
OK.

1185
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:39,958
Please raise your right hand,
and repeat...

1186
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:42,750
I swear by Almighty God...

1187
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,542
I swear by Almighty God...

1188
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,417
..that I will tell the truth...

1189
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:58,792

You're a cunt!

1190

[hushed chatter]

1191
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:03,542
Mr Davidson,
please leave the court.

1192
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,875
-That I will tell the truth.
-Mr Davidson,

1193
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:09,167
please leave my court.

1194
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:14,417
Mr Davidson, if you do not
remove yourself from my court,

1195
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:18,667
I will have you man-handled.
Mr Davidson,

1196
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,000
-please leave my court.
-I swear by Almighty God...

1197
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:23,375
I swear by Almighty God
that I will tell the truth.

1198
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:26,292
-Mr Davidson!
-Cunt!

1199
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:28,917
-Cunt, fuck, cunt!
-Leave!

1200
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:34,125
John. Come on, love.
It's all right.

1201
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:39,167
[tics]

1202
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:46,708
[tics] I'm a retard. I'm a spaz.

1203
01:13:46,792 --> 01:13:50,542
You fucked it up.
You fucked it up, John. [tics]

1204
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:58,000
[tics]

1205
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:03,000
-Tommy.
-[continues to tic]

1206
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It's not going well, Tommy.
He called the judge a cunt.

1207
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:10,667
-Well, that's not good.
-No.

1208
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:17,208
[Tommy] <i>John is, without doubt,</i>

1209
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:19,542
<i>the best employee
I've ever had.</i>

1210
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:24,042
Does... Does he shout? Yes.
Does he swear? Yes.

1211
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,000
Does he mean any harm?
Absolutely not.

1212
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:28,875
-[tics]
-His tics are uncontrollable.

1213
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:32,625
There's times, two or three
times a day, his right hand

1214
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:35,708
will just thrust right out
like that, clenched fist.

1215
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:39,000
It'll come to about an eighth
of an inch away from my face.

1216
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:43,583
That's how good he is. He's got
it down to an absolute fine art.

1217
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:47,292
Two or three times a day, he'll
skelp me in my homos, right?

1218
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:49,417
Now... Can I say homos?

1219
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,292
I'm sure it's not any worse
than what we've heard already.

1220
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:54,125
All right, so I can say it?

1221
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:58,792
You know what I mean
when I say homos? Balls?

1222
01:14:58,917 --> 01:15:02,708
Meat and two veg? Crown jewels?
Gonads? Testicles?

1223
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:05,208
-Bollocks!
-[judge] Thank you, Mr Trotter.

1224
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:08,875
-I think we have it.
-Right, I just wanted to check.

1225
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:12,417
OK. It is a medical condition.
Right?

1226
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,333
It exists. I see it every day.

1227
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:18,875
Now, I understand
that some people

1228
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:21,250
are saying that he's pretending.

1229
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:24,667
Can I ask, why would you pretend
to have a condition

1230
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:27,792
that results in you being
hit with a crowbar?

1231
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:31,167
That resulted
in you being humiliated

1232
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,792
and ridiculed at school

1233
01:15:32,917 --> 01:15:35,375
by being refused
to sit your higher exams

1234
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,292
that could improve your life?

1235
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:39,583
That stops you
having a relationship?

1236
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:43,250
Who, who would pretend
to have such a condition?

1237
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:44,458
[tics] Me.

1238
01:15:44,542 --> 01:15:46,625
Now, I know
John's a proud young man,

1239
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:50,542
and he wouldn't like me
using the word "disability",

1240
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:55,125
but can I just ask,
if a blind man walks into a bar,

1241
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:59,542
and crashes into another guy,
would it end up in court?

1242
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:02,000
Huh?

1243
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:06,583
Now, that young man over there
would not harm a fly.

1244
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,958
He is, he is the nicest,

1245
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:13,917
kindest, most respectful
young man I have ever met.

1246
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:17,250
And he makes
a damn fine cup of tea.

1247
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,208
Spunk for milk.

1248
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,208
Spunk for milk.

1249
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,417
Can I...
Sorry. Sorry, Your Honour.

1250
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,917
Thank you, Mr Trotter.

1251
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,208
[man] John, did that outcome
surprise you?

1252
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:33,458
No. The sheriff said it should
never have gone to court.

1253
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:36,167
[man 2] Dottie, what was the
most significant moment for you?

1254
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,208
Oh, well, it's when he said

1255
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:41,125
that the police needed
to learn from this experience.

1256
01:16:41,208 --> 01:16:43,583
Uh, Tommy Trotter,
friend of the family.

1257
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:46,333
Just wanted to say what that boy
did in there was incredible.

1258
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:48,667
-You can quote me on that.
-[man] Are you proud of John?

1259
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,875
Me?
Well, I'm always proud of John.

1260
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:52,583
[man 2] So, John,
where do you go from here?

1261
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:54,292
[Tommy]
I'll tell you where he goes.

1262
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:56,083
Back to
the community centre with me,

1263
01:16:56,167 --> 01:16:58,583
and he helps me clean out
those drains.

1264
01:16:58,667 --> 01:17:00,958
-That's what he does.

I'm off to see Tommy today,

1271

Had a hospital appointment.

1272

Will you tell him
bingo's cancelled on Thursday?

1273
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,792
I will indeed.
See you later, Irene.

01:23:09,542 --> 01:23:10,958
Yeah?

1353
01:23:11,042 --> 01:23:13,000
OK, here we go.

1354
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:14,875
Thank you.

1355
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:18,167
-Excited to show you it.
-Yeah?

1356
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:19,958
[exhales]

1357
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:23,042
Right, that's the last box.

1358
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:25,542
-Sure you're all right, John?
-No worries.

1359
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,292
I'll go get in the lift, Mum.
See you soon, man.

1360
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:31,250
-Thanks, pal.
-OK. So, um...

1361
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:34,542
-you'll be all right then?
-Aye.

1362
01:23:37,042 --> 01:23:40,042
Aye, I'll be fine, Dot. Come on.

1363
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:42,625
[Dottie] It's gonna be quiet
at home without you.

1364
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:44,792
[John] I know. [chuckles]

1365
01:23:44,917 --> 01:23:47,708
And, um, well, you'll come
for Sunday lunch, won't you?

1366
01:23:47,792 --> 01:23:49,625
-Of course I will.
-Great.

1367
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:51,750
Oh, and, uh, remember,

1368
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:53,625
-no swearing.
-[chuckles]

1369
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:55,667
See you later, Dot.

1370
01:23:57,708 --> 01:23:59,250
[door closes]

1371
01:24:09,292 --> 01:24:10,875
I'll go for a wank.

1372
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:13,167
[tuts] Fuck off, John.

1373
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:16,250
[tics]

1374
01:24:18,542 --> 01:24:20,208
Fuck off!

1375
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:23,542
-[man] Who's he shouting at?
-[man 2] No one.

1376
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:24,750
Cunt!

1377
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:27,333
-[John tics]
-You all right, mate?

1378
01:24:27,667 --> 01:24:30,542
-Aye, no worries.
-Who you swearing at, then?

1379
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:33,583
No one, it's just what I do.
It's a medical condition.

1380
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:35,875
-What?
-Where do you live?

1381
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:38,500
-Fuck off, nosy.
-[laughter]

1382
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:40,750
That was a tic.
You just gotta ignore 'em.

1383
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:43,583
-You'll get used to me.
-[laughter]

1384
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,500
Anyway,
I better be getting back.

1385
01:24:45,542 --> 01:24:47,625
Got a frozen lasagne
defrosting in here.

1386
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,542
Which flat's yours then?

1387
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:54,708
[♪ "Numb" by Portishead]

01:24:57,167 --> 01:25:00,125
[laughter and chatter]

1389
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:03,375
[man] Oh, are youse all right?
How's the bar?

1390
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:06,042
Fucking tell her.
Let's fucking tell her.

1391
01:25:07,542 --> 01:25:10,375
[chatter continues]

1392
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:20,333
-You all right, mate?
-Aye.

1393
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,958
Brought you a beer.

1394
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:25,333
Thanks.

1395
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:28,625
[scoffs]

1396
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,292
What's with the bars?

1397
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:35,125
Stop me...

1398
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:37,625
jumping over the side.

1399
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:41,250
Jeez.

1400
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:52,125
It's a nice flat.

1401
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:54,625
Could do with spending
some money on it, though.

1402
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:57,208
What do you mean?

1403
01:25:57,292 --> 01:25:59,875
Well, get like
a big fuck-off TV.

1404
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:02,083
A new sofa.

1405
01:26:02,167 --> 01:26:03,792
I can't afford that, pal.

1406
01:26:05,542 --> 01:26:09,417
-Come work for me.
-I've got a job.

1407
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,375
In your spare time,
come work for me.

1408
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:18,542
-But then again...
-What?

1409
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:20,917
Maybe, I don't know...

1410
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,958
-What?
-Well...

1411
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:26,083
Your disability might
get in the way.

1412
01:26:26,167 --> 01:26:28,167
It's not a fucking disability.

1413
01:26:33,333 --> 01:26:36,292
I can do whatever you need
doing. What do you need?

1414
01:26:38,042 --> 01:26:39,167
Take that.

1415

-It's in the bag.
-What?

1418
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:06,250
-It's in the fucking bag.
-Oh, right. [clears throat]

1419
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:09,208
I've got a bag like this,
you know. I use it for work.

1420
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:11,167
Really good pockets.

1421
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:15,667
Is this what I think it is?

1422
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,667
Is this for Danny?

1423
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:20,458
Look at that.

1424
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:31,125

01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:02,667

-Stop where you are. Come here!

1433
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,292
Come here.

No, no, it's nothing like that.
I've got, um...

1436
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:13,125
I've got drugs up my jumper.
I've got Tourette's syndrome.

1437

-I can't help what I say.
-Is that right, aye?

1438

Let's see your hands.

Get your hands
out of your jumper!

What's that?

1442
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,667
-What is that?
-Crack cocaine, you cunt.

1443
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,625
-Half-price heroin!
-Right, that's enough.

1444
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:39,042
No, I don't even know
what it is.

Fuck off!

1450
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,542
What he just said there.

1451
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:02,125
That gave us grounds
to arrest him.

1452
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:05,208
So what has he actually done?

1453
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:07,083
[policeman]
He was carrying a package

1454
01:29:07,167 --> 01:29:09,542
which he claimed
was crack cocaine.

1455
01:29:10,708 --> 01:29:13,208
-And was it crack cocaine?
-No.

1456
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,208
It was a bag of sugar.

1457
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:19,500
But next time, they'll trust you
with the real thing.

1458
01:29:19,542 --> 01:29:22,250
You can't arrest him for
what might happen the next time.

1459
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:24,167
Look,
he should not be locked up.

1460
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:28,583
He cannae help what he says.
He has Tourette's syndrome.

1461
01:29:28,667 --> 01:29:30,583
He has an attitude problem,
is what he has.

1462
01:29:30,667 --> 01:29:32,625
Dottie's got drugs in her pussy.

1463
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,708
Right, is he free to go?

1464
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:38,125
-Yeah.
-OK. Davidson, come on.

1465
01:29:38,708 --> 01:29:42,458
Let's get you home where
I can keep an eye on you.

1466

Nice cup of tea.

Aye, sorry about that.

01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:12,750
I'm sorry.

1472
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:15,375
That estate was a bad idea.

Aye.

01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:27,667
-What are you reading?
-A book on Tourette's.

1475
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,833
I think you should read it.
You know, in fact,

1476
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:33,542
we should both read whatever
we can get our hands on.

1477
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:35,917
Learn as much as we can.

1478
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:38,958
What do you think?

1479
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:44,833
Aye. Aye.

1480
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:47,542
-Good idea.
-Hmm.

1481
01:30:48,542 --> 01:30:51,542
I'm being sacked today.

-All right, pal?
-Aye, John. Yeah. Sit down.

1484
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:01,833
It's like a fucking sauna
in here, you cunt.

1485
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:04,833
-You want me to open a window?
-No, no, no. It was just a tic.

1486
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:06,750
I don't think you're a cunt
or anything.

1487
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:10,125
[laughs, clears throat] John,
you'll be more than aware that

1488
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:13,042
we've been looking
for a full-time...

1489
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:14,958
-Sorry.
-Ah, no problem.

1490
01:31:15,042 --> 01:31:18,000
A full-time caretaker, yeah.
Have you found someone?

1491
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:21,542
-[clears throat]
-No one's as good as me.

1492
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:23,542
That was a tic.

1493
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:26,792
-No, it wasn't a tic, John.
-Aye, it was. It was a tic.

1494
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:28,083
It was a premonition.

1495
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:31,167
John, there isn't anyone
as good as you, that is a fact.

1496
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:33,042
And that's why
we would like to offer you

1497
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:35,958
the position of caretaker,
permanently.

1498
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:42,792
Think about it. You realise
that if you were to accept,

1499
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:45,125
which we dearly hope you will,

1500
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,542
the position comes
with accommodation.

1501
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:51,042
It's not exactly a palace,
but it's comfortable.

1502
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:56,000
-All right, well, um...
-Congratulations.

1503
01:31:56,667 --> 01:32:00,250
Aye. Thank you. Thank you.
I won't let you down.

1504
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:04,708
You definitely won't, no.
You've earned it.

1505
01:32:05,542 --> 01:32:08,125
Right, well, uh...
I'd better be getting on.

1506
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:10,417
Got some chairs to set up
and things to do.

1507
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,667
Lovely. Thank you, John.

1508
01:32:15,042 --> 01:32:17,042
-Listen to that.
-Hmm.

1509
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:18,417
-Silence.
-[tics]

1510
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:21,542
-Oop, well... [laughs]
-Sorry. [chuckles]

1511
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:25,292
[Dottie] Oh, it's a lovely
wee house, John.

1512
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:27,292
-Hmm?
-Hmm.

1513
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:32,625
-Tommy loved it here.
-Aye, he did.

1514
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:35,083
It's just what you need.

1515
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,083
Maybe I could get a wee dog
like Rosie.

1516
01:32:39,167 --> 01:32:43,083
[Dottie] Hey, and look at that.
That crow there, that is Tommy.

1517
01:32:43,167 --> 01:32:45,542
-[John] Don't be stupid.
-That, my friend, is a sign.

1518
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:48,125
-What? No, it's true.
-[John] It's not a sign.

1519
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:50,958
[Dottie] Like a spirit animal,
you know what I mean?

1520
01:32:51,042 --> 01:32:52,250
[crow caws]

1521
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:55,417
-How you doing, Tommy?
-[John] All right, Tom?

1522
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,333
-[they laugh]
-[Dottie] See? He's not moving.

1523
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:08,917
-[knocking at door]
-Fuck off! Hello?

1524
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:12,792
-Are you John?
-[John] Aye. Sorry about that.

1525
01:33:12,917 --> 01:33:14,708
We got your details
from the hospital.

1526
01:33:14,792 --> 01:33:17,250
They said you might
be able to help.

1527
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:20,042
Doctors and specialists,
they talk about Tourette's,

1528
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:21,917
but they haven't experienced it.

1529
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,208
[John] Hmm.

1530
01:33:23,292 --> 01:33:25,667
She's never met
anyone else who has it.

1531
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:28,250
[knocks on window]

1532
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:30,917
Lucy, could you step outside
the car, please?

1533
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,333
[Lucy] Fuck off!

1534
01:33:32,917 --> 01:33:34,958
We've got John with us.

1535
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:38,000
OK, open up.

1536
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:44,125
[tics] Just fuck off, you paedo.
I'm a minor.

1537
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:47,917
What are you doing that for?

1538
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,125
Stop me giving you
a smack in the face.

1539
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,583
[chuckles]

1540
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:54,375
-I'm not talking to you.
-Ah, no worries.

1541
01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:57,333
To be honest, it's nice to
have a few minutes off work.

1542
01:33:57,417 --> 01:33:58,917
Part-time slag!

1543
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
-I spunked on a jellyfish today.
-You're a wanker.

1544
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:04,083
-Roddy's got a little cock.
-Fuck off.

1545
01:34:04,167 --> 01:34:07,458
-I've got a big fucking rabbit.
-I shagged your mum.

1546
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:10,250
-Fuck you. Cunt.
-[tics]

1547
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:13,042
-Your dad wasted sperm.
-Your dad's a cunt.

1548
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:14,750
-My dad's a paedophile.
-I'm a paedo.

1549
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:16,333
[Lucy] I'm the leader
of the paedos.

1550
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,500
[John] I raped a girl.

1551
01:34:17,542 --> 01:34:19,083
[Lucy]
You're on the offenders list.

1552
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:21,083
-[John] I'm a fucker.
-My dad shagged your dad.

1553
01:34:21,167 --> 01:34:22,792
My dad's a fucking jellyfish.

1554
01:34:22,917 --> 01:34:25,167
-[Lucy] My mum's a virgin.
-Shall I go in?

1555
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:27,083
-Maybe not.
-[John] You're a flabby cunt.

1556
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:29,750
-My mum's a priest.
-You're a priest, you cunt.

1557
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:32,042
You're a wank stain.

1558
01:34:37,417 --> 01:34:38,958
[clears throat]

1559
01:34:39,042 --> 01:34:41,417
-You all right, pal?
-Aye.

1560
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,208
[both laugh]

1561
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:45,333
[lighter clicks]

1562
01:34:45,417 --> 01:34:47,833
-What's her name?
-[John] Tilly.

1563
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:50,208
Or we call her Tilly-Lilly.

1564
01:34:51,417 --> 01:34:53,292
-Do you like dogs?
-Yeah.

1565
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:56,000
I want one, but dad says
they're too much hassle.

1566
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:57,958
[John] They are, trust me.

1567
01:34:58,042 --> 01:35:00,833
But she helps me understand
what's going on with me,

1568
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:02,583
-I think.
-Yeah.

1569
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:05,542
Hello.

1570
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:11,083
Ah, fuck off!

1571
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:15,000
Are you OK?

1572
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:18,375
Yeah, I think I just had to
get it out in the car earlier.

1573
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:20,417
-Like, when it all builds up.
-Yeah.

1574
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,792
You're pretty good at
suppressing your tics then?

1575
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:24,625
Sometimes it just, like,

1576
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:26,917
depends on how the day's going,
you know?

1577
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:30,542
The hospital send people to me
every now and again.

1578
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:34,125
But, to be honest, I'm not
really sure how much I help 'em.

1579
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:37,625
I thought you were a specialist,
the way my dad was going on.

1580
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:40,625
No, no. I'm not a specialist,
but I've read a bit.

1581
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:41,958
Yeah.

1582
01:35:43,042 --> 01:35:46,250
You're the first person
I've met with Tourette's.

1583
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:49,542
Does it help?

1584
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:52,000
-Not at all, you wanker.
-[chuckles]

1585
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:54,917
Um, no, yeah, I'd say so.

1586
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,917
Like, you understand it
better than...

1587
01:35:59,167 --> 01:36:00,500
Good.

1588
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:03,625
[whispers to the dog]

1589
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:05,708
Did you get bullied or anything?

1590
01:36:05,792 --> 01:36:08,833
Oh, aye, yeah, when
I was at school, yeah, but...

1591
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:12,167
now it's more about
being laughed at, or teased,

1592
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:14,458
or people taking photos of you,
and whatever.

1593
01:36:14,542 --> 01:36:15,833
Yeah.

1594
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:18,792
Some mornings, I wake up
and I can be feeling great,

1595
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:20,708
and then I'll just
burst out crying.

1596
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:22,292
Really?

1597
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:25,542
I just wonder what I did
to deserve to be like this.

1598
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:29,833
Then when I try
and get close to someone...

1599
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:32,458
I think, who's gonna want to
spend their life with someone

1600
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:34,333
who's gonna swear
and spit in their face?

1601
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:39,083
Yeah, that's what I worry about.
Cos that'll hurt, you know.

1602
01:36:41,792 --> 01:36:43,542
See, sometimes, like,

1603
01:36:43,625 --> 01:36:46,458
if my mum's making the dinner
or something like that, and...

1604
01:36:46,542 --> 01:36:49,458
like, she's got the stove on,
and it's scalding hot, like...

1605
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:52,375
Like, I need to put my hand
on it. Yeah, yeah.

1606
01:36:52,458 --> 01:36:54,792
Not even...
Like, proper smack it.

1607
01:36:54,917 --> 01:36:57,250
That's compulsion.
I do that as well.

1608
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:59,500
-Really?
-Yeah. I can lend you a book.

1609
01:36:59,542 --> 01:37:02,833
Yeah. I don't know, like, I...
I don't know if you get it,

1610
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:04,917
you have to do it,
you cannot walk away from it.

1611
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,958
I know exactly what you mean.
I have to kiss the lamppost.

1612
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:09,417
[laughs]

1613
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,917
-I don't do that.
-[chuckles]

1614
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,458
I shag letter boxes.

1615
01:37:14,542 --> 01:37:16,833
-Don't do that either.
-[chuckles]

1616
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:23,625
Right, well, I better be
getting back to work.

1617
01:37:25,542 --> 01:37:28,458
-Has this helped or not?
-Yeah, no, massively.

1618
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:31,208
Like, you understand it
more than...

1619
01:37:31,292 --> 01:37:33,458
like, the specialists do.

1620
01:37:33,542 --> 01:37:36,292
Good. Well, I'm on Facebook
if you want a chat.

1621
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:39,292
Yeah. You're good at this.

1622
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:42,042
Wait till your dad sees my bill.

1623
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:44,750
I like that blue bite piece
around your neck.

1624
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:46,375
Oh, it's like a...

1625
01:37:46,458 --> 01:37:48,792
Like, you bite it whenever
you think you're gonna tic.

1626
01:37:48,917 --> 01:37:50,458
I've got one.

1627
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:53,375
-Yeah? This is better, though.
-[laughs]

1628
01:37:55,792 --> 01:37:57,375
Go on, then.

1629
01:37:59,042 --> 01:38:01,375
Go see Tommy. Go on, then.
Go see him.

1630
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:02,958
<i>All right, Trotter?</i>

1631
01:38:06,042 --> 01:38:08,542
What can I tell you?
[clears throat]

1632
01:38:12,458 --> 01:38:15,750
Up the community centre today,
guess what happened.

1633
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:20,333
That lead flashing on the toilet
block started leaking, again.

1634
01:38:20,417 --> 01:38:22,792
I've told them they can come
back down and fix it for free.

1635
01:38:22,917 --> 01:38:24,417
We're not paying.

1636
01:38:31,667 --> 01:38:33,708
Met a couple the other day.

1637
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:36,375
They brought their daughter
to see me.

1638
01:38:36,458 --> 01:38:38,667
Twenty-four, young lady.

1639
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:41,167
She's got tics.

1640
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:46,167
And I was the first person she'd
ever met who has Tourette's.

1641
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,458
Can you believe that?

1642
01:38:52,917 --> 01:38:56,000
You always said I should do more
to help people like me,

1643
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:58,042
-kids and stuff.
-[pours water]

1644
01:38:59,792 --> 01:39:02,042
And I'm having a think, Trotter.

1645
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:04,042
I'm having a think.

1646
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:10,542
Come on then, Tilly.

1647
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:12,417
Come on then, girl.

1648
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,208
In there. Come on, guys.

1649
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:27,542
[tics]

1650
01:39:29,042 --> 01:39:30,750
Good to see you, Lucy.
You OK?

1651
01:39:30,833 --> 01:39:33,125
-It's nice to see you.
-Nice to see you, too.

1652
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:36,417
Bring it over here.

1653
01:39:36,667 --> 01:39:39,250
-Alison. Is it John?
-Alison. Yeah.

1654
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:41,208
He's been screaming
since Birmingham.

1655
01:39:41,292 --> 01:39:43,542
-[boy] Fuck off, you wanker!
-Let's get him in and settled.

1656
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,792
[tics] Ignore me.

1657
01:39:45,917 --> 01:39:48,917
-Pop!
-[various tic noises]

1658
01:39:52,125 --> 01:39:54,833
I just wanted to
welcome you all here.

1659
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:56,542
[man] Are you my real dad?

1660
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:58,917
This is the first Tourette's
weekend we're doing, so...

1661
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,375
some of you are meeting people

1662
01:40:00,458 --> 01:40:02,542
with Tourette's for
the first time, and that's OK.

1663
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:04,083
-Fuck off!
-Hello, pal, you OK?

1664
01:40:05,042 --> 01:40:06,750
-[child] Fuck off.
-[Dottie] John.

1665
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:11,167
Can I ask what made you think
this was a good idea? [laughs]

1666
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,750
-[laughter]
-[various tic noises]

1667
01:40:13,833 --> 01:40:17,958
-I just wanted to say...
-[child] Can I touch your penis?

1668
01:40:18,042 --> 01:40:21,500
Today...
Today, you are the majority,

1669
01:40:21,542 --> 01:40:24,083
and you're not the minority.

1670
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:26,250
[cheering and applause]

1671
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:37,167
So, my name's Greg,

1672
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:39,583
and, just like you guys,
I have Tourette's.

1673
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:41,542
I just wanna show you
a couple of things

1674
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:43,083
that I do, on the drums,

1675
01:40:43,167 --> 01:40:45,458
to help give you
a couple of tips and tricks

1676
01:40:45,542 --> 01:40:47,250
to reduce your tics.

1677
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:48,542
This is billed as a weekend

1678
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:50,125
for those
living with Tourette's,

1679
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:52,542
but that's you
as well as your kids.

1680
01:40:52,625 --> 01:40:54,333
Look, you're not superhuman.

1681
01:40:54,417 --> 01:40:57,083
This stuff is really difficult
to live with, and...

1682
01:40:57,167 --> 01:40:59,708
it most likely split up my own
family, my mum and dad.

1683
01:40:59,792 --> 01:41:02,625
So... you need to look after
each other.

1684
01:41:02,708 --> 01:41:05,792
Could you split yourselves
off into groups? [tics]

1685
01:41:05,917 --> 01:41:08,042
And I'm gonna give each group
a camera...

1686
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:11,417
Put your finger on
the drumstick, about a third...

1687
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,333
Get the fuck out
of the classroom!

1688
01:41:13,417 --> 01:41:14,958
I'll fucking punch your cunt in.

1689
01:41:15,042 --> 01:41:18,125
[man] We can all start getting
creative and tap into that side.

1690
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,333
Homosexual man in the house.
[barks]

1691
01:41:20,417 --> 01:41:22,958
How do you manage
with relationships?

1692
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:25,083
Personally?

1693
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:30,542
For me, that has been
quite a challenge, but...

1694
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:33,292
you know, as parents,
you're going to want

1695
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:35,917
your kids to find a partner
and settle down,

1696
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,208
that's only natural.

1697
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:39,375
But it all goes back
to education.

1698
01:41:39,458 --> 01:41:40,667
The problem is not Tourette's,

1699
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:43,417
the problem is that people don't
know enough about Tourette's.

1700
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,000
<i>The sooner
these kids are accepted,</i>

1701
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:46,375
<i>the sooner they're understood,</i>

1702
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:48,958
<i>the sooner they can go on and
lead a completely normal life.</i>

1703
01:41:51,292 --> 01:41:54,083
-Get down!
-Empty your pockets!

1704
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:59,833
Well done, Davidson.

1705
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:02,667
Aye, well done, Dottie.

1706
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:06,583
-Oh! Jesus Christ, you see that?
-[laughs]

1707
01:42:08,167 --> 01:42:10,500
Go on then! Stay.

1708
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,583
Go on then! Stay.

1709
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:20,333
-Come on, Tilly.
-[siren sounds]

1710
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:23,292
-Come on, Tilly.
<i>-Stop where you are.</i>

1711
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:24,583
<i>Put your hands on your head.</i>

1712
01:42:24,667 --> 01:42:27,000
Haven't done anything wrong,
pal.

1713
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:29,792
<i>Stop where you are, Davidson.</i>

1714
01:42:29,917 --> 01:42:33,083
Fuck's sakes. What is it?

1715
01:42:33,167 --> 01:42:35,167
[policeman]
Do you not remember me?

1716
01:42:36,125 --> 01:42:37,542
No.

1717
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:41,375
You've done nothing wrong.

1718
01:42:42,208 --> 01:42:43,750
It's MacCullen.

1719
01:42:44,542 --> 01:42:45,958
Aye, MacCullen.

1720
01:42:46,042 --> 01:42:47,792
-How are you?
-I'm good.

1721
01:42:47,917 --> 01:42:51,167
You bald wanker.
Fuck's sakes. Sorry.

1722
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:55,250
I first met John when I was
a young PC in Galashiels.

1723
01:42:55,333 --> 01:42:58,000
He was a young man,
it was the early '90s,

1724
01:42:58,083 --> 01:43:01,167
and, uh, very few people
knew what Tourette's was.

1725
01:43:01,667 --> 01:43:06,417
Now, the police force did not
serve him well at that time.

1726
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:09,042
I didn't serve him well.

1727
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:11,667
Which was why,
when I was promoted,

1728
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:14,333
one of the first things I did
was find John

1729
01:43:14,417 --> 01:43:17,333
and ask him if he would
speak to you today. John.

1730
01:43:17,417 --> 01:43:19,750
OK. Thanks for having me
here today.

1731
01:43:19,833 --> 01:43:23,083
Um, obviously, this is a very
nerve-racking event for me.

1732
01:43:23,167 --> 01:43:26,250
-Fuck the police!
-[laughter]

1733
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:27,417
John.

1734
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:30,792
Sometimes what I say is funny,
and I even laugh myself,

1735
01:43:30,917 --> 01:43:33,292
but that's very different
to actively teasing,

1736
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:35,542
or mocking,
or encouraging people to swear.

1737
01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:37,792
Everyone who lives
with Tourette's is different.

1738
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:40,250
We've got our own symptoms
and tics and behaviours.

1739
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:44,083
A tic can be anything. It can
be a vocal tic or a motor...

1740
01:43:44,167 --> 01:43:48,750
[tics] A vocal tic like that.
Or we can have eye blinking,

1741
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:51,792
or people roll their eyes
sometimes, like that.

1742
01:43:51,917 --> 01:43:54,083
One of the things we don't
talk about with Tourette's

1743
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:56,708
is the anxiety, or the
obsessive compulsive disorder,

1744
01:43:56,792 --> 01:43:59,167
the exhaustion from trying
to pretend nothing is wrong,

1745
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,625
from trying
to suppress the tics.

1746
01:44:00,708 --> 01:44:03,250
Now, imagine trying to
hold in a thousand big sneezes.

1747
01:44:03,333 --> 01:44:05,917
You can do it for a while,
but then what happens?

1748
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,625
-You'll explode.
-You explode. Good answer.

1749
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:10,250
How do you manage, for example,

1750
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:11,917
if you've got to go
to a library?

1751
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,250
That's a nightmare for me.
I can't go to a library.

1752
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:18,417
I'd love to,
um, but it's too quiet.

1753
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,458
Don't engage in a conversation
with the tics, just ignore them.

1754
01:44:21,542 --> 01:44:23,292
The person insulting you
is guilty of nothing.

1755
01:44:23,375 --> 01:44:25,167
They need support
and understanding.

1756
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,750
Thanks for listening
to me today.

1757
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:28,958
I hope you've learnt something
about Tourette's.

1758
01:44:29,042 --> 01:44:31,125
And, yeah, thank you.

1759
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:33,417
[cheering]

1760
01:44:36,542 --> 01:44:37,917
Cheers.

1761
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:41,958
That was good.

1762
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:53,708
Post! Fucking post time.
[clears throat]

1763
01:44:56,833 --> 01:45:00,208
[phone rings]

1764
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,917
Ah.

1765
01:45:02,708 --> 01:45:06,125
-Morning, Davidson.
-Dottie. Dottie.

1766
01:45:07,083 --> 01:45:08,792
What's wrong?

1767
01:45:08,875 --> 01:45:11,000
Mr John Davidson,

1768
01:45:11,083 --> 01:45:14,583
for services to those
with Tourette's syndrome.

1769
01:45:29,083 --> 01:45:31,458
[Queen] And congratulations.

1770
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:35,417
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
[clears throat]

1771
01:45:48,125 --> 01:45:52,542
-I didn't know you'd made it.
-I'm so proud, John. Oh...

1772
01:45:52,667 --> 01:45:55,542
Oh, we hit traffic,
and then the security...

1773
01:45:55,667 --> 01:45:58,042
But I was there. I saw you.

1774
01:45:58,125 --> 01:45:59,875
Hm. Good, good.

1775
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:02,250
Meet Dottie and Chris.
This is my sister, Caroline.

1776
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:04,250
I'm so glad you could come,
love.

1777
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:06,375
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1778
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:08,917
-How's Mum?
-Oh, she is... she's good.

1779
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,167
-And she's pleased.
-Good.

1780
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:14,375
-You should go see her.
-Aye, I will. I will.

1781
01:46:17,792 --> 01:46:21,500
-[chuckles] So nice to see you.
-Really good to see you.

1782
01:46:38,167 --> 01:46:40,583
-Here we are, John.
-Hmm.

1783
01:46:43,042 --> 01:46:45,875
-Now, do you still take sugar?
-Oh, aye.

1784
01:46:45,958 --> 01:46:48,792
Well, that's good,
cos I've already put one in it.

1785
01:46:48,875 --> 01:46:50,250
[John chuckles]

1786
01:46:50,333 --> 01:46:53,042
Come on, now. Let's see it.

1787
01:46:53,125 --> 01:46:55,208
Right, OK.

1788
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:59,333
[makes fanfare sound]

1789
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:02,208
-There it is.
-Oh.

1790
01:47:02,292 --> 01:47:05,875
-Oh. It's lovely, John.
-Hmm.

1791
01:47:05,958 --> 01:47:07,583
-You'll have to polish it.
-Hmm.

1792
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:10,208
I'm going to get some proper
silver polish, a clean cloth,

1793
01:47:10,292 --> 01:47:13,542
sort of lint thing.
Get in all those bits there.

1794
01:47:13,583 --> 01:47:16,542
[mother] Well...
Be careful you don't lose it.

1795
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,583
I won't.

1796
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,167
So, you had a nice day,
with the Queen?

1797
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:26,417
Oh, aye, yeah. After I told her
to go fuck herself.

1798
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:30,708
-Oh, John, you didn't?
-I know. It was fine, though.

1799
01:47:35,917 --> 01:47:38,500
I only had three tickets, Mum,
and...

1800
01:47:38,542 --> 01:47:42,042
-as Caroline lives closest...
-I understand, John.

1801
01:47:42,167 --> 01:47:43,833
[John] No, no, it wasn't that.

1802
01:47:43,917 --> 01:47:46,708
It's just, you know,
the way it worked out.

1803
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,167
[mother] Hmm.

1804
01:47:51,042 --> 01:47:53,542
I read about it all
in the paper, John.

1805
01:47:53,583 --> 01:47:55,500
Apparently you said
you didn't want

1806
01:47:55,542 --> 01:47:57,500
anyone to go through
what you went through.

1807
01:47:57,542 --> 01:47:59,208
Face the fireplace.

1808
01:47:59,292 --> 01:48:00,667
Fuck's sakes.

1809
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:05,000
I'm sorry I wasn't good enough.
I tried my best, I did.

1810
01:48:05,083 --> 01:48:09,292
-[John] I know. I know, Mum.
-[sighs]

1811
01:48:13,125 --> 01:48:14,458
[clears throat]

1812
01:48:18,042 --> 01:48:22,583
I wouldn't have known
what to do, if I was you or Dad.

1813
01:48:23,167 --> 01:48:25,125
I couldn't have coped.

1814
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:28,083
I know.

1815
01:48:30,667 --> 01:48:32,750
[chuckles softly]

1816
01:48:32,833 --> 01:48:34,875
So, there was light
at the end of the tunnel

1817
01:48:34,958 --> 01:48:37,292
after all, John Davidson?

1818
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:42,708
Yeah.

1819
01:48:47,875 --> 01:48:50,750
Yep. If only we knew it...

1820
01:48:52,833 --> 01:48:54,708
way back then.

1821
01:48:58,042 --> 01:49:00,833
-Come on, you.
-[clears throat]

1822
01:49:05,375 --> 01:49:07,083
It's OK, John.

1823
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:09,542
It's OK.

1824
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:13,667
I'm sorry, John.

1825
01:49:14,958 --> 01:49:16,792
[John] You don't have to be.

1826
01:49:26,667 --> 01:49:28,125
[woman] <i>Dear Mr Davidson,</i>

I'll meet you back at reception.

30... 30 years ago,

1882
01:54:13,542 --> 01:54:16,375
because the answer
was always the same.

1883
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:18,792
-It's... it's not a cure.
